# Artificial Neural Networks and Computational Intelligence

Welcome to the repository for Artificial Neural Networks and Computational Intelligence course at AUT. This course provides an in-depth overview of Artificial Neural Networks and its applications in Computational Intelligence.
in this repo we have implemented basic building blocks of neural network.
then will use these blocks to make networks for some specific applications.
